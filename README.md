# Sound_and_vibration_measurement
This is a project created with STM32L073RZT6 using STM32CubeMX, Keil uVision 5, itemisCREATE programs. It has a MPU6050 accelerotemer and gyroscope sensor (only the accelerometer is used here) and MAX9814 microphone as well as an OLED 128x32px 4pin. Its puspose is to measure the sound and vibration of the environment. The measured value (sound or vibration) is changed using the user button that is on the NUCLEO-L073RZ. The sound is measured in the 0,1-5 kHz bandwidth, every 0,5 seconds the RMS value is calculated and transmitted to a computer using UART. Every second the value is indicated in the OLED. The vibration is measured in the 0-400 Hz bandwidth, every 0,1 seconds the RMS value is calculated and transmitted to a computer using UART. Every 3 seconds the value is indicated in the OLED.
